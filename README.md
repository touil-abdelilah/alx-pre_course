- **README**: A README is a file that provides information about a project, including how to use it and contribute to it.
- **Writing Good READMEs**: Include clear and concise instructions, project overview, and any necessary documentation.
- **Committing**: Use `git commit -m "Commit message"` to commit changes to the repository.
- **Commit Messages**: Write informative commit messages that explain the changes made in the commit.
- **Pushing Code**: Use `git push` to push code to a remote repository.
- **Pulling Updates**: Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- **Creating a Branch**: Use `git branch branch-name` to create a new branch.
- **Merging Branches**: Use `git merge branch-name` to merge a branch into the current branch.
